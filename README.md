# Quick TLScontact France Form Filler

This script is designed to help individuals fill out the TLScontact France appointment form quickly and efficiently. TLScontact deletes personal data every 10 days, making it cumbersome to re-enter information repeatedly. By using this script, you can save time and effort by automating the data entry process for commonly required fields.

## Features

- Automatically fills out personal information, passport details, and travel dates on the TLScontact France form.
- Dynamically generates buttons for multiple users, enabling quick selection of pre-saved data.
- Automatically calculates a default travel date (30 days from the current date).
- The generated button panel stays fixed at the top of the page for easy access, even while scrolling.

## Installation and Usage

### Copy the Code&colon;

Copy the JavaScript code provided in `script.js`.

### Integrate the Script&colon;

1. Use a browser extension like **Tampermonkey** or **Greasemonkey** to run the script on the TLScontact France form page.
